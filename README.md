GOALS OF THIS PROJECT:

Given Edward Snowden's revelations of mass surveillance being conducted by the United States National Security Agency and its partners, the importance of public discussion of the value of privacy has never been greater.

This project aims to collect individual testimonials of the value and importance of privacy to oneself. To roll back massive global invasion of privacy by government agencies, technological and legal solutions are required, such as the use of strong encryption and the enforcement of constitutional protections. But the political will to make the change is also needed. Perhaps this project can make a small contribution to building that political will to eradicate these massive and ongoing invasions of our privacy.

Pull requests are welcome and needed. Thank you for your contributions.
